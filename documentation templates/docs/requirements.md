## User Needs

### User stories

As an insurance broker I want to see how a client moving house will affect the risk that I am insuring, so that I can charge more if they are increasing risk. 

As a motorist I want to see how me moving house may affect my insurance premiums so I can see how much my yearly premiums may increase/decrease so I can budget more accuratly. 

As a commuter and pedestrian I want to see hotspots for car crashes so I know where I need to be more cautious, what areas I might need to avoid, or the nature of common accidents in the area. 

As a lobbyist I want to see hotspots for fatal crashes so I can highlight key problem areas and put pressure on improving the infrastructure there.

### Actors
