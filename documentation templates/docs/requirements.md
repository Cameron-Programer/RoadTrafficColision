## User Needs

### User stories

As an insurance broker I want to see how a client moving house will affect the risk that I am insuring, so that I can charge more if they are increasing risk. 

As a motorist I want to see how me moving house may affect my insurance premiums so I can see how much my yearly premiums may increase/decrease so I can budget more accuratly. 

As a commuter and pedestrian I want to see hotspots for car crashes so I know where I need to be more cautious, what areas I might need to avoid, or the nature of common accidents in the area. 

As a lobbyist I want to see hotspots for fatal crashes so I can highlight key problem areas and put pressure on the highway department to improve the infrastructure there.

### Actors
- Insurance broker
- Road User
- Traffic engineers
- Tourists
- Towing/recovery companies
- Lobbyists/protesters

| **Assumptions**    | There is a road on within the network with a substantial number of fatal crashes that has not been improved since the incident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Steps**          | 1) Lobbyist looks at the heat map using the filter to only show Fatal collisions<br>2) Lobbyist identifys the road with a large amounts of fatal injurys and checks to see if it has been improved since the last crash<br>3) Lobbyist informs the coulcle highways dept to ask for it to be improved<br>3.1) If the councle ignore the issue then they should speak to their MP <br>3.2) If the MP ignores this issue go to the local press and speak to the MP again after. |

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
#### FR1 [UC1] 
The system shall present two input boxes to take input of two post codes. 
One postcode being the users previous postcode and the other being their new postcode. 

#### FR2 [UC1]
The system shall generate a list of top ten roads within a user defined radius that have had collisions on them. 
These will be presented in order of most incidents to least. 

#### FR3 [UC2] 
The system should generate a list of every collision in Bristol in a format that is able to be overlay-ed onto a map.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### N-FR1 [UC1]
The system could also present the data plotted onto a map as a visual aid for users. 

#### N-FR2 [UC2] 
The system could also present collision data points on a map in the form of a heat mzap. As a visual aid to make it easier to understand. 

#### N-FR3 [UC1 & UC2]
The system should present an menu for the user to filter collision by their category. 
e.g (Minor,Serious,Fatal)

#### N-FR4 [UC2]
The system could load the map at broad mead if Geo-location is not available from the browser
