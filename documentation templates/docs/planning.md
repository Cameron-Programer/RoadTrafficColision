# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
When you move house you are very likely to be driving on new roads, being able to easily see the roads near you that are the most dangerous would be advantageous as drivers would know to be extra cautious on these roads.
By being able to review the collision data for your current address and your new address you will be able to estimate if you need to budget for an increase in insurance on renewal 

### Business benefits
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.

### Options Considered
There appear not be be any public facing products in this category that do what this project is attempting (most likely because its not a particularly profitable product)

The few alternatives that I can see are:
- OpenDataBristol - Users could just manually review the data 
	NOTE: There are other councils that publish data in this way (e.g. London) but they all fall under this category 

### Expected Risks
- Risk of legal action if analysis of data is incorrect 

## Project Scope
- Displaying analised RTC data
- Having a visual display using a map 
	- Have an alternative for users who are using a screen reader. 

- Potential an account system for commerisal use. (Could charge for a licence)
