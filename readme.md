# Road Traffic collision

This project is using the [Traffic collision](https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/fff13e074ca74a14b9f444735b5b73bf_41/explore) data set  

This could have a number of uses such as:

- Heatmap of collision points
- List of roads with a high number of collisions for their length
- Heatmaps of junctions with lots of fatal collions it.

We plan to have interativity with the user
